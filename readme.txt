WP-WebAuthn enables passwordless login through FIDO2 and U2F devices like Passkey, FaceID or Windows Hello for your site.

== Description ==

WebAuthn is a new way for you to authenticate in web. It helps you replace your passwords with devices like Passkeys, USB Keys, fingerprint scanners, Windows Hello compatible cameras, FaceID/TouchID and more. Using WebAuthn, you can login to your a website with a glance or touch.

When using WebAuthn, you just need to click once and perform a simple verification on the authenticator, then you are logged in. **No password needed.** If your device supports Passkey, your authenticator can roam seamlessly across multiple devices for a more convenient login experience.

WP-WebAuthn is a plug-in for WordPress to enable WebAuthn on your site. Just download and install it, and you are in the future of web authentication.

WP-WebAuthn also supports usernameless authentication.

This plugin has 4 built-in shortcodes and 4 built-in Gutenberg blocks, so you can add components like register form to frontend pages.

Please refer to the [documentation](http://doc.flyhigher.top/wp-webauthn) before using the plugin.

**PHP extensions gmp and mbstring are required.**

**WebAuthn requires HTTPS connection or `localhost` to function normally.**

Please note that this plugin does NOT support Internet Explorer (including IE 11). To use FaceID or TouchID, you need to use iOS/iPadOS 14+.

= Security and Privacy =

WebAuthn has become a W3C Recommendation since March 2019, which enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users using hardware authenticators.
